[Nuxt Black Dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/nuxt-black-dashboard) is a beautiful Bootstrap 4 Admin Dashboard that comes in 2 versions: Dark and Light Mode. If you are looking for a tool to manage and visualize data about your business, this dashboard is the thing for you. It combines colors that are easy on the eye, spacious cards, beautiful typography, and graphics.

We made it our priority to not add things that you don't need, so the Nuxt Black Dashboard comes with just enough features for you to easily use. It combines multiple components and plugins and features numerous example of how it can be used. Inside the archive, you will also find multiple example pages to get you started or provide inspiration.

[Nuxt Black Dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/nuxt-black-dashboard) is the extended version of [Black Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/black-dashboard). Based on feedback from people that downloaded and used it, we have added needed components, and we have created multiple examples pages. We are curious to see how you want to use it and also improve it, so let us know any feedback you have.
